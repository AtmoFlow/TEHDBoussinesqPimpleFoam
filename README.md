# Introduction

TEHDBoussinesqPimpleFoam is a solver developed for OpenFOAM, a powerful open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. This solver is designed to handle thermo-electro-hydrodynamic (TEHD) problems, providing a comprehensive toolset for simulating complex interactions between thermal, electrical, and fluidic phenomena.
Features in incompressible flows. It also can solve problems in a non-dimensional way.

# Running the solver
## Installation
Clone this repository:

`git clone git@github.com:AtmoFlow/TEHDBoussinesqPimpleFoam.git`

Compile the solver. This requires the OpenFoam development tools (base-dev or devel)

`wmake` 

## Configuration
Consistent with the scientific community around TEHD, the solver can solve directly in a non-dimensional way. A detailed description of the scaling of variables to obtain a dimensionless equation is provided in the paper. Turbulent flow can only be solved with the dimension-affected solver. By default, the solver runs dimensional. To enable dimensionless calculation add `solveDimless yes;` to the  `transportProperties` file. For scaling purposes, the non-dimensional solver requires additional properties such as the heat diffusion `kappa` and the geometric length scale `d` defined in the same file.

**Additional TEHD settings**
The solver is derived from the `buoyantBoussinesqPimpleFoam`. In addition to solving TEHD, the electric potential needs to be defined as `Ue` in Volts for the boundaries. `zeroGradient` needs to be set to electric inert boundaries. Additionally, further transport properties need to be defined to solve the dielectrophoretic force, such as the relative permittivity reference `epsilonr0` value at temperature `TRef` but its expansion coefficient `e` analogous to the Boussinesq approximation for buoyant flows.
Moreover, the solver can process dielectric heating for polar fluids under the influence of an alternative current. For this, the `dielectricHeat yes;` setting needs to be added to the `transportProperties`. Then, the solver requires further properties: the frequency `f` of the alternative source, the heat capacity `Cp`, and the dissipation factor `hdiss`.

**Rotating reference frame**
The solver can solve rotating problems in a rotating reference frame, defining the apparent forces, Coriolis force, and centrifugal force. The rotation axis is not adjustable and is defined as the origin z-axis. The solver considers centrifugal buoyancy by setting the density expansion coefficient `beta`. The rotation rate is defined as scalar `omega` in the transport properties.

## Tutorials
The *example* folder provides two examples for the same parameter setting, with the case in the *non-dim* folder running dimensionless and the case in the *dim* running dimensional. `Allrun` runs the mesh construction and decomposition on two cores and starts the parallel calculation, while `Allclean` returns to the initial state. Two different `0` folders are located in these folders. First, the `0.isotherm` defines uniform temperature boundary conditions while `0.atmospheric` mimics an atmospheric-like temperature boundary condition used in the paper. The uniform boundary condition is chosen for the tutorial to save calculation resources since the convection develops faster.
