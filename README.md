TEHDBoussinesqPimpleFoam is a solver developed for OpenFOAM, a powerful open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. This solver is specifically designed to handle thermo-electro-hydrodynamic problems, providing a comprehensive toolset for simulating complex interactions between thermal, electrical, and fluidic phenomena.
Features in incompressible flows. It has the ability to solve also in a non-dimensional way

Installation

Clone this repository:


`git clone git@github.com:AtmoFlow/TEHDBoussinesqPimpleFoam.git`

Navigate to the solver directory:

`cd TEHDBoussinesqPimpleFoam`

Compile the solver. This requires the OpenFoam development tools (base-dev or devel)

`wmake` 

Documentation

Detailed documentation will be provided in future in the docs directory. It includes information on solver usage, input file specifications, and customization options.
